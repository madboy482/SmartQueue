## ‚ú® Overview

**SmartQueue** is not just another task manager. It's an intelligent productivity system that uses the Knapsack algorithm to automatically prioritize your tasks based on importance and available time. With real-time algorithm visualization, gamification features, and an elegant UI, SmartQueue transforms task management from a chore into an engaging experience.

> "Managing time isn't about squeezing more tasks into your day, but about prioritizing the ones that truly matter." ‚Äî SmartQueue Philosophy

## üíª Technical Highlights

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Task Optimization** | Knapsack algorithm (O(n*W) complexity) for optimal task selection within time constraints |
| **Task Sorting** | Merge Sort algorithm (O(n log n) complexity) for efficient list management |
| **State Management** | React Context API for centralized gamification and user progress tracking |
| **Data Persistence** | Local storage implementation with robust error handling |
| **Performance** | Optimized rendering with React memo and callbacks |
| **Accessibility** | WCAG-compliant color schemes and keyboard navigation |

```javascript
// Example of our Knapsack algorithm implementation
const knapsackOptimization = (tasks, timeLimit) => {
  // Create DP table
  const dp = Array(n + 1).fill().map(() => Array(timeLimit + 1).fill(0));
  
  // Fill dp table (simplified)
  for (let i = 1; i <= tasks.length; i++) {
    for (let w = 0; w <= timeLimit; w++) {
      if (tasks[i-1].time <= w) {
        dp[i][w] = Math.max(
          dp[i-1][w], 
          dp[i-1][w-tasks[i-1].time] + tasks[i-1].importance
        );
      } else {
        dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w];
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Return optimized selection
  return backtrack(dp, tasks, timeLimit);
};
```
